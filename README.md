# LANDRO17_3D_UNITY_SIM
The following is a 3D Unity simulation for an evolving robotics reaserch project (Vassar URSI 2017).

Using Unity 5.6.1 and C#.

GtoP: This project contains only the scripts which generate an artifical genome and simulate a developmental process that turns a given genome into a matrix of connected nodes for an artifical neural network. Proof of concept for the Neural network in conjunction with the Genome to Phenotype developmental process.

3dLANDROsim: Simulates Landro and the XOR developmental/evolutionary task. Contains and integrates the genome to phenotype scripts in GtoP.

	- Adjust irThreshold and ldrThreshold values in the main script 
	  in order to change the percentages of "good XOR" and "bad XOR" areas in the simulated environment.
