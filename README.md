# LANDRO17_3D_UNITY_SIM
The following is a 3D Unity simulation for an evolving robotics reaserch project (Vassar URSI 2017).
Using Unity 5.6.1 and C#.

GtoP: This project generates an artifical genome and simulates a graphical process that turns a given genome 
into a matrix of connected nodes for an artifical neural network.

3dLANDROsim: Simulates Landro and the developmental/evolutionary task.
