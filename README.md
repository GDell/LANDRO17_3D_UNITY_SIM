# LANDRO17_3D_UNITY_SIM
The following is a 3D Unity simulation for an evolving robotics reaserch project (Vassar URSI 2017).
This project simulates Landro and the XOR developmental/evolutionary task.

This project uses the Unity 5.6.1 game engine, you will need it downloaded in order to run simulations.

	Important Functions and Structs by File Name

		genomeHandler: This file manages creating genomes, the G->P process, and creating generations of individuals.
				gene 
				genome
				genotypeToPhenotype
				createParams

				generation

		IR:

		LDR:

		SimpleCarController: Controlling Simulated Landro and gathering sensor data.
			runMotors(): 

		NeuralNetworkHandler:

		MainMenu: 

		Main: This file is constantly active while the simulation is running. It manages trials including 


		


	- Adjust irThreshold and ldrThreshold values in the main script 
	  in order to change the percentages of "good XOR" and "bad XOR" areas in the simulated environment.
